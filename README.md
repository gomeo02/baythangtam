It's a decade since a police helicopter crashed through the roof of the Clutha Bar in Glasgow.

Among those there that Friday night was Michael Byrne. He helped pull survivors from the rubble at the city centre bar, where 10 people lost their lives.

Although Michael managed to escape without injury, the emotional impact the tragedy had on him was long-lasting.
